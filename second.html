<p>The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a Marxist-Leninist sovereign state in Eurasia that 
existed from 1922 to 1991.[10] Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics,[d] its government and economy were highly 
centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the 
Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, Alma-Ata, 
and Novosibirsk. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) 
north to south. It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert and mountains.The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October 
Revolution, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II 
during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed by a treaty which legalized the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, 
Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics that had occurred from 1918. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, 
Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism–Leninism and constructed a command economy 
which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During his rule, political paranoia fermented and the Great Purge 
removed Stalin's opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people, resulting in at least 600,000 deaths.
In 1933, a major famine struck the country, causing the deaths of 3 to 7 million people.[12]

Before the start of World War II in 1939, the Soviets signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression agreement with Nazi 
Germany, after which the USSR invaded Poland on 17 September 1939. In June 1941, Germany broke the pact and invaded the Soviet Union, 
opening the largest and bloodiest theatre of war in history. Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict 
in the effort of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad and Kursk. The territories overtaken by 
the Red Army became satellite states of the Soviet Union. The post-war division of Europe into capitalist and communist halves would lead 
to increased tensions with the United States-led Western Bloc, 
known as the Cold War. Stalin died in 1953 and was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin and began the 
de-Stalinization. The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred during Khrushchev's rule, which was among the many factors that led to his downfall 
in 1964. 
In the early 1970s, there was a brief détente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed with the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979. 
In 1985, the last Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost (openness) 
and perestroika (restructuring), which caused political instability. In 1989, Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe overthrew their 
respective communist governments.

As part of an attempt to prevent the country's dissolution due to rising nationalist and separatist movements, a referendum was held in 
March 1991, boycotted by 3 Soviet republics, that resulted in a majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the
union as a renewed federation. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's high-profile role in 
facing down a coup d'état attempted by Communist Party hardliners. In late 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet 
Union met and formally dissolved the Soviet Union. The remaining 12 constituent republics emerged as independent post-Soviet states, 
with the Russian Federation—formerly the Russian SFSR—assuming the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and being recognized as the 
successor state.The Soviet Union was a powerhouse of many significant technological achievements and innovations of the 20th century, 
including the world's first human-made satellite, the first humans in space and the first probe to land on another planet, Venus. 
The country had the world's second largest economy and the largest standing military in the world.[16][17][18] The Soviet Union was 
recognized as one of the five nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.
It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as well as a member of the Organization for Security 
and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the leading member of the Council for
Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact.</p>
